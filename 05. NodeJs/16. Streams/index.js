// In Node.js, streams are a way to handle reading and writing data.
//They provide a way to work with large amounts of data, such as
//reading a large file or receiving a large amount of data over a
//network connection, without loading the entire dataset into
//memory.Streams can be readable, writable, or both, and can be used to
//pipe data between different sources and destinations.

import { createReadStream } from "fs";

//👇 The (highWaterMark) property controls the size of the buffer, We can (increase/decrease) that
//const stream = createReadStream("16. Streams/data.txt", { highWaterMark: 90000 });

// const stream = createReadStream("16. Streams/data.txt");
// stream.on("data", (data) => {
//   console.log(data);
// });

// 👇 We can also provide encoding to it, and it will gives us acutal content.
const stream = createReadStream("16. Streams/data.txt", { encoding: "utf8" });

stream.on("data", (data) => {
  console.log(data);
});

// 👇 We also have "error" event, which will fire if we have error
stream.on("error", (err) => console.log(err));
