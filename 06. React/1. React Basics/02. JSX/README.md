1. **JSX (JavaScript XML)**: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript, which allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. It's commonly used with React to describe what the UI should look like.

2. **Integration with JavaScript**: JSX can seamlessly integrate JavaScript expressions within curly braces `{}`. This allows you to dynamically render content based on variables or expressions.

3. **Component Structure**: JSX allows you to define React components using a familiar HTML-like syntax. In your example, the `App` component is defined using a function that returns JSX.

4. **HTML-like Syntax**: JSX resembles HTML, making it easier for developers who are already familiar with web development to get started with React. However, it's important to remember that JSX is not HTML; it's compiled to JavaScript by tools like Babel before being rendered by the browser.

5. **Component Composition**: JSX supports component composition, allowing you to create complex UIs by combining smaller, reusable components. In your example, the `App` component can be composed with other components to create larger UI structures.

6. **Attributes**: JSX allows you to specify HTML attributes and their values using a syntax similar to HTML. For example, `<h1>Hello my name is Ayush</h1>` sets the `Hello my name is Ayush` text as the content of the `<h1>` element.

7. **Event Handling**: JSX allows you to attach event handlers to DOM elements using camelCase syntax. For example, `onClick`, `onChange`, etc. These event handlers can call functions defined in your component.

8. **[Babel Compilation](https://babeljs.io/repl)**: JSX code needs to be compiled into JavaScript using tools like Babel before it can be understood by browsers. This compilation process converts JSX into regular JavaScript function calls, which React understands and can render.

Overall, JSX simplifies the process of building UI components in React by providing a familiar syntax and allowing seamless integration with JavaScript.
